# OptiMorphic Precision Vision (OPV) Framework

## Overview

The OptiMorphic Precision Vision (OPV) Framework is a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to remove JPEG artifacts from images. Built on TensorFlow 2.1, this model enhances the quality of JPEG images by effectively reducing noise and improving image clarity, making it ideal for both professional and recreational use.

For a detailed explanation of the artifact removal process, the purpose behind it, and insights into the model architecture and training, please refer to our comprehensive article.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with TensorFlow 2.1. Follow the steps below to set up the OPV Framework on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OPV-Framework.git
   ```
   Replace `https://github.com/your-username/OPV-Framework.git` with the actual URL of your repository.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the cloned directory and run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command installs all necessary libraries required for the OPV Framework.

## Training and Inference

### Dataset Preparation

Ensure that your dataset is placed in the same directory as the repository to allow the training script to access it directly.

### Model Training

Execute the following command to start training the model:
```bash
mkdir outputs
python train.py --steps 20000
```
This command trains the model for 20,000 steps and outputs the results, including the model checkpoints and summaries, in a folder named `outputs`.

### Inference

To run inference and see the model's performance on an image from your dataset, use:
```bash
python infer.py --ckpt_path path/to/UNET_month_day_hour_minute_second/ckpt-20000
```
Replace `path/to/UNET_month_day_hour_minute_second/ckpt-20000` with the actual path to your trained model checkpoint. The inference script outputs two images: the original (downgraded) image and the artifact-removed (enhanced) image.

## Model Architecture

The OPV Framework utilizes a U-Net architecture, renowned for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks. The model's architecture and training process are designed to specifically target and mitigate JPEG artifacts, leading to significantly enhanced image quality.
